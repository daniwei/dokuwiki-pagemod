Dokuwiki Pagemod2 Plugin
================

Pagemod2 Plugin for DokuWiki

This plugin is forked from https://github.com/BaselineIT/dokuwiki-pagemod. The original plugin is apparently not developed further. This plugin is also not developed professionally, but is occasionally adapted and expanded to suit own needs.

All documentation for this plugin can be found at
https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:pagemod2

This plugin provides an additional action for the Bureaucracy Plugin - https://www.dokuwiki.org/plugin:bureaucracy.

Unfortunately it is not possible to replace the `pagemod` commands directly. So you have to change existing `pagemod` actions in your forms to `pagemod2`.

If you install this plugin manually, make sure it is installed in
`lib/plugins/pagemod2/` - if the folder is called different it
will not work! Please refer to http://www.dokuwiki.org/plugins for additional info
on how to install plugins in DokuWiki.
